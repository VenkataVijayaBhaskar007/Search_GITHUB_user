# Getting Started with Create React App

***click<a href ="https://venkatavijayabhaskar007.github.io/Search_GITHUB_user_/"> here</a> to live demo***

### Prerequisites 

&#x1F537; learn `react` from <a href="https://reactjs.org/">here <img align="center" src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/react-2.svg" width="30" height="30">
 </a>

&#x1F537;This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



### Steps to install

1.Install node in your pc

2.After downloading my project open it in your code editor

3.go to the file where you wanna start npm(cd "yourfolder name") (or) start it directly in the folder which you downloaded from my repository<br/>


4.Run command `npm install` (this command will install all the node modules you needed for project)

5.After that run command `npm start` (This command will redirect your project to browser)

6.Finally the output will be came in your browser with `localhost:3000`

## Go through below commands if you want to learn more about react


### `npx create-react-app <react-app-name>`

after running this command a folder will be created with given name, here it's `react-app-name`

packages will be installed automatically with this command 

you can see this type of structure after installation of all the packages

### `cd my-app`


this command will help you to locate folder where you want to install ***npm***

followed by command `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
